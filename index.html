    <p>Hi, You've reaches Darran's Project page on Sourceforge. Here you'll find links to the various projects I've
    worked on over the years, and are able to offer as open source for others to use and enjoy.</p>

    <p>I am currently working as a Software Developer at <a href="http://www.schatzforensic.com.au/">Schatz Forensic</a>,
    primarily working on <a href="https://evimetry.com/">tools</a> in support of Digital Forensics. Professionally, 
    I work with a various languages and platforms including 
    C++11 (GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OSX, Windows, Solaris), Java (SWT including Eclispe e4) and various scripting languages. </p>

    <p>I completed a Bachelor of Information Technology (Software Engineering) at Queensland University of 
    Technology (Brisbane, Australia) with distinction in 2013, and have previously worked in the IT industry in various System
    Administration and Technical roles for the past 15+ years. I am also members with the ACM, and formally held membership with the IEEE, IEEE Computer Society.</p>

    <p>My current personal projects focus on desktop applications for Unix based environments (Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris)
    utilising either C/C++ (GTK+) or Java (Swing). Previous projects have been in a number of languages and environments 
    including but not limited to: Pascal, x86/x64 assembler, b0, C# and Forth. On a range of platforms from MS-DOS, 
    Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista/7, GNU/Linux, Android, FreeBSD and Solaris 9/10/11.</p>

    <p>The projects are generally released under either the BSD license or the GPL v3 license, and are available to use
    under those terms and conditions.</p>

    <p>I am reachable at chewy509 at mailcity dot com for any questions you may have.</p>

    <h1 id="Projects">Projects</h1>

    <p>I currently maintain all current projects on GitHub, my older personal programming projects on Sourceforge, and all my prior Universirty Assessment Pieces on GitHub and BitBucket.</p>

    <h2>Github</h2>

    <h3><img src="css/occillo.svg" alt="Occillo" width="48" height="48">&nbsp;&nbsp;Occillo</h3>

    <p>Occillo is Breakout style arcade game. Features 25 levels of gameplay, SVG based graphics for hiDPI displays, and a rocking soundtrack. For more iformation please visit the project homepage at <a href="https://dkartaschew.github.io/occillo/">https://dkartaschew.github.io/occillo/</a></p>

    <h2>Sourceforge</h2>

    <h3><img src="css/logo.png" alt="gMTP&gt;"></h3>

    <p>gMTP is one of my larger projects, and is designed to allow easy interface to MTP based devices such as mp3
    players, mobile phones and tablets. It's currently available as a package in the majority of Linux based
    distributions. For more iformation please visit the project homepage at <a href="http://gmtp.sourceforge.net/">http://gmtp.sourceforge.net</a></p>

    <h3><img alt="b0 Logo" src="css/b0.png" height="48">&nbsp;&nbsp;B0</h3>

    <p>B0 is a low level programming langauge I developed to aid in writing an operating system for 64bit Intel/AMD
    based systems. B0 can be found at the sourceforge project page at <a href="http://b0language.sourceforge.net/">http://b0language.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

    <h3><img src="css/icon.png" alt="gDesktopChanger" height="48">&nbsp;&nbsp;gDesktopChanger</h3>

    <p>gDesktopChanger is a simple wallpaper changer for GNOME 2 and JDS environments. gDesktopChanger can be found at
    the sourceforge project page at <a href="http://gdesktopchanger.sourceforge.net/">http://gdesktopchanger.sourceforge.net</a></p>

    <h3>&gt;_ &nbsp;&nbsp;256b</h3>

    <p>256b is an Operating System that takes up a mere 512 bytes and is designed to run directly from a boot sector.
    256b is written in x86 assembler and makes use of "unreal-mode" to be able to access upto 4GB of memory. 256b was
    developed for a <a href="http://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?t=2164&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0">programming
    competition</a> and ranked 5th in the competition standings. Further details on 256b can be found at the
    sourceforge project page at <a href="http://os-256b.sourceforge.net/">http://os-256b.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

    <h2>Github (University Projects)</h2>

    <h3><img alt="ACM ICPC Logo" src="css/cm2-logo-panel_joel_wo_lang.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;ACM-ICPC Competition Guide for
    Students</h3>

    <p>The ACM-ICPC Competition Guide for Students is a guide developed for students who wish to take part in the
    annual ACM-ICPC competition. The guide itself is split into three major sections, the first section on the
    competition itself, the second on performance considerations, and the third on all common algorithms that are
    typically required to be competitive within the competition. All alogrithms include a description of the algorithm,
    an implementation in either C++ or Java, and an associated sample problem that makes use of the algorithm.</p>

    <p>The GitHub project including all source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/dkartaschew/acm-comp-guide">https://github.com/dkartaschew/acm-comp-guide</a>, and the guide
    itself in PDF form can be found <a href="https://github.com/dkartaschew/acm-comp-guide/raw/master/Document/ANZAC%20Guidebook.pdf">here</a>. (The guide
    itself was written using Lyx).</p>

    <p>Note: ACM-ICPC Logo copyright of the ACM-ICPC competition</p>

    <h3><img alt="Solar Logo" src="css/solar.png" height="48">&nbsp;&nbsp;Solar Power Calculator for Android</h3>

    <p>This project was part of a group assessment piece, with myself developing the Android based client application
    as part of a larger server and client based project. The Android application can be found at <a href="https://github.com/dkartaschew/SolarCalculatorAndroid">https://github.com/dkartaschew/SolarCalculatorAndroid</a>.
    (The Android client commuicates with a server application that runs on Google App Engine, via SOAP/XML. The
    component that runs on GAE can be found <a href="https://github.com/dkartaschew/anonymous-solarenergy">here</a> and
    which also includes a desktop based Java application - This component was developed by the whole team).</p>

    <h2>BitBucket</h2>

    <h3><img alt="Bioinformatics Logo" src="css/bioinformatics.gif" height="96">&nbsp;&nbsp;Bioinformatics Research</h3>

    <p>My projects/repositories at BitBucket are primarily focused on Bioinformatics research in support of rapid search
    and comparison of genomic information. (Genome data was based on various bacteria). The project utilised ElasticSearch
    as the supporting platform to conduct the research, and the project included customisation of ElasticSearch and new 
    custom tokenisers to work with the data.</p>

    <p>The research report can be located in the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/dkartaschew/bioinformatics.search.report">bioinformatics.search.report</a> 
    repository, and all supporting software elements for the research can be found <a href="https://bitbucket.org/dkartaschew/">here</a>.</p>
